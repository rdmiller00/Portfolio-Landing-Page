                <h3 id="flex-item12">Journey to Software</h3>
                    <p>As a software developer, I strive to balance work ethic, creative desire, and a passion for fostering high-performing teams to provide value from day one, wherever I am. My journey to the tech world has been unconventional – transitioning from an 11-year career in the U.S. Army as a Special Operations Bomb Technician where I won the 2016 Army Soldier of the Year competition and most importantly to me, had the honor of serving with incredible teammates who strived to make a difference every day. 
                    <br>
                    <br>My time in the military taught me to overcome adversity, adapt to new challenges, and excel in high-pressure situations. It also instilled in me a strong sense of leadership, grounded in empathy and care for the well-being of those I work with. I'm here to apply those principles to the world of software development.
                    <br>
                    <br>My greatest joy comes from being part of a collaborative, innovative team and leading others to success. My hope in making the jump into tech is to continue doing work that really matters, work that allows my love for solving complex problems to come through in creative ways. I love the chance to fail forward and learn new skills every day, but it doesn’t happen alone, so I can’t wait to hear from you!
